      "Question": "When is OACETT proposing to implement continuing professional development?",
      "Answer": "OACETT is proposing to implement mandatory continuing professional development beginning in January 2016."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What is the rationale to implementing continuing professional development?",
      "Answer": "OACETT is committed to ensuring that members maintain competence to abide by the first tenet of the Code of Ethics:  “hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public, the protection of the environment and the promotion of health and safety within the workplace.”  Recent structural failures and professional accountability have caused government inquiry panels, such as that for the Elliot Lake Algoma mall collapse, to call for mandatory continuing learning to increase the likelihood of currency and competence.  It is important to safeguard market recognition and to add value to our designations.  Our members need to be seen as relevant, in demand and contributing to economic competitiveness."
    },
    {
      "Question": "How difficult will it be to fulfil the continuing professional development requirements?",
      "Answer": "Ongoing professional development is not difficult and many members will already be in compliance with OACETT’s proposed CPD.  Many employers include professional development as an inclusive part of the employee growth plan and the selection of activities can be self-directed or employer-directed.  Own your profession and make this work for you."
    },
    {
      "Question": "Who does the continuing professional development program apply to?",
      "Answer": "The continuing professional development program applies to all certified members (working full or part time), Life and Fellow OACETT members unless retired (not working more than 100 hours per calendar year) and associate members admitted to membership pre July 2005 whose membership has been continuous."
    },
    {
      "Question": "Who does the continuing professional development program not apply to?",
      "Answer": "The continuing professional development program does not apply to associate members admitted to membership post July 1, 2005, students, retired (not working more than 100 hours per calendar year) and honourary members."
    },

      "Question": "Am I required to complete continuing professional development to maintain my OACETT membership?",
      "Answer": "Continuing professional development is required by all members listed in question #4 to maintain their membership with OACETT."
    },
    {
      "Question": "Why is an associate member admitted to membership post July 1, 2005 not required to complete professional development?",
      "Answer": "Certification is required for associate members admitted to membership post July 1, 2005.  These members have been given either 3 or 6 years to become certified and this is determined during the file review.  Continuing professional development will be required once these members are certified."
    },
    {
      "Question": "I am a certified member on maternity/parental/medical leave/unemployed.  Am I automatically exempted from the continuing professional development program?",
      "Answer": "No, you are not automatically exempted from the continuing professional development program.  You may even want to maintain your professional development while away from work.  You need to make application to the Registrar for extension of the time line for continuing professional development requirements."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What are the requirements for the mandatory professional development?",
      "Answer": "Members must participate in four learning activities over the course of three years. Each three-year cycle, members are required to complete three activities from any of the following categories:  contributions to the profession, peer and professional interaction, contributions to technical knowledge and management/leadership training; plus one formal course or self-directed study either from technical knowledge or management/leadership training."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What are acceptable examples of continuing professional development in each of the four categories?",
      "Answer": "For acceptable examples of continuing professional development in each of the four categories, please contact us."
    },
    {
      "Question": "How do I know if my continuing professional development activity will be accepted by OACETT?",
      "Answer": "We have provided many examples of what is acceptable covering most CPD possible activities.  If still in doubt, when selecting your continuing professional development activities ask:  “Does this activity make me a better technology professional?”"
    },
    {
      "Question": "What will members be required to produce as supporting documents to show they are compliant?",
      "Answer": "For audit purposes, verification of 3 activities and one formal course or self-directed study will require documentation to confirm completion of the activity or course.  Acceptable documentation may take such forms as: 1) transcript, receipt of payment with course outline, certificate of completion/attendance, 2) written confirmation from employer that member attended and passed, 3) submission of the article written or presentation given, 4) study notes and resource lists"
    },
    {
      "Question": "How will OACETT monitor compliance?",
      "Answer": "Every 3 years, regulated members (Certified and pre July 2005 Associates) will declare at the time of membership renewal that they have completed their continuing professional development requirements.  Members can log their activities using any method that works best for them but will be encouraged to use OACETT’s CPD log that will be available."

    },
    {
      "Question": "Who will monitor compliance?",
      "Answer": "IETO, the Institute of Engineering Technology of Ontario, OACETT’s certification division will audit CPD compliance."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What if I fail to comply?",
      "Answer": "Certified members and Associates admitted to membership pre July 2005 not in compliance may be given a “grace period” of 6 months to comply; after which, failure to comply will result in resignation of membership."
    },
    {
      "Question": "Can I reinstate after losing my membership due to CPD non-compliance?",
      "Answer": "Yes; submit proof of compliance and once approved you may apply for reinstatement.  The reinstatement fee will be waived for prior members who meet compliance and return to membership within one year of being resigned for CPD non-compliance.  All other regular reinstatement rules apply which may have potential implications on your membership status – see next question."
    },
    {
      "Question": "What are the OACETT reinstatement rules?",
      "Answer": "Members may reinstate up to five years after resignation or lapse of membership after which they must re-apply as a new member. For prior certified members that wish to reinstate, regular reinstatement rules will apply:Resigned Members will not be reinstated to designations that are no longer awarded such as Certified Engineering Technician or Applied Science Technologist. The current designation in use at the time of reinstatement that represents the appropriate level of certification will be granted. Those members who have not completed the Professional Practice Exam (PPE) prior to resignation will be required to pass the PPE within 6 months of reinstatement or will have their certification removed and will be classified as Associate members with three years to comply or lose membership. They would become subject to the 3/6 year timeline for certification.  See Question #7 above. Reinstatement fee will be waived for prior members who meet compliance and return to membership within one year of being resigned for non-compliance. For Associate members pre July 2005, upon reinstatement you will be treated the same as members who were admitted to membership on or after July 1, 2005.  That is, you will need to attain certification within the 3 or 6 year timeline determined by your certification program assigned at time of reinstatement."
